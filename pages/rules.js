            Average Information &ndash; please read rules 6-8 carefully
          </h2>
          <li>
            Any bowler entering OKClassic 2020 must establish a ten-pin average acceptable to USBC. The following rules
            shall be used to determine the entering average.
            <ol>
              <li>
                Only 10-pin averages can be used.
              </li>
              <li>
                The ending 2019-2020 FALL USBC certified composite book average (minimum of 21 games) or 12-month IGBO
                TAD average (minimum 18 games) as of July 1, 2020. The higher of the two will be used as your entering
                average.
              </li>
              <li>
                If no 2019-2020 composite book average, use HIGHEST CURRENT League Average (as of July 1 ,2020) with a
                minimum of 21 games. Current Standing Sheet(s) as of July 1, 2020 will be required.
              </li>
              <li>
                If none of the above is available, then the entering average shall be 220.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            If current Summer season league average (as of July 1, 2020) for at least 21 games exceeds 2019-2020
            composite book average (or Igbo TAD average of 18 games) by 10 pins or more, current season league average
            will be used (Rule 319a, Item 2).
          </li>
          <li>Each bowler is responsible for verification of all averages existing on the USBC website (
            <a href='http://www.bowl.com/'>www.bowl.com</a>
            ) under Tournament Rule 6. If all averages are not on the bowl.com website, then League standing sheet or
            other acceptable verification must be either submitted as available online from all leagues in which a
            bowler has 21 or more games and/or IGBO Tournament in which a bowler has 18 or more games. Failure to use
            proper average shall disqualify scores if the submitted average is lower than the actual average, thereby
            resulting in a lower classification or more handicap. Prize winnings will be based on the submitted average,
            if it is a higher than the correct average (Rule 319a, Item 3). Please email standing sheets to
            okclassicbowling@gmail.com.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Tournament Directors have the authority to adjust the entering average of any bowler. Average
            adjustments will be applied as set forth under (Rule 319e). All average adjustments will be completed prior
            to the start of each tournament event. A bowler unwilling to accept an average adjustment is entitled to a

          in a low man out competition for prize money. (If there are not enough entries for a division, other
          options will be used at the time of the tournament.) Entry fee will be returned 100%.
